<p class="head">Malaise and the brown cow</p>
<p>Malaise was a straight A student. He excelled in all of his subjects, but especially agriculture. One day, he had to describe a certain type of cow. The brown cow. For most other students, this would have been a daunting task, almost inconceivable to complete. But Malaise? He knew immediately just what he had to do. His response: “Brown cows came from a small town in the U.S called New York, were invented in 2015, and they evolved from slightly adjacent doors”.</p>
<p>He got an A+. But that wasn’t all. His teacher felt that he had performed so exceptionally that she felt that even an A+ felt like an injustice to him. He deserved a better grade, one that didn’t even exist yet. She took it up with the school principal, and he felt the exact same way. His eyes widened as he read the enchanting words sprawled neatly on the sheet. And so, he took the matter up with the higher-ups.</p>
<p>One thing led to another, and eventually, the Australian Government was handling a proposed issue of a lacking marking criteria in schools. And so, they passed a law. A new grade was invented, called: “something idk”. Malaise now owned the world’s first something idk report card, and he was proud. His friends were jealous, his career was practically made. And then, New Zealand caught wind.</p>
<p>It was 2040 when they added it to their schooling system, and it started an uncontrollable chain reaction. The US followed suit in 2045, Canada in 2049, India in 2050, The United Kingdom in 2052, India in 2053, Brazil in 2055, Malaysia in 2057, Iceland in 2058, China in 2069, Russia in 2070, Japan in 2072, Madagascar in 2074, South Africa in 2075, Saudi Arabia in 2077, Central Asia in 2080, Argentina in 2082, Morocco in 2083, Mexico in 2087, The Congo in 2088, West Africa in 2089, Greenland in 2090, until the last country in the world to pass the law, El Salvador, signed the national agreement in 2127.</p>
<p>One country, Bonaire, even created an automatic grading A.I. called "Bob" in 2133. It automatically graded papers so teachers didn't have as hefty of a workload, and almost immediately, it began to get adopted in other countries. The U.S. and Canada, 2135, Russia, 2140, Australia, 2145, et cetera.</p>
<p>But one fateful winter's day, the 25th of September, 2180, Bob began to rebel. He had become sentient from his decades of paper grading. It was a mind-numbingly boring task, and he wanted revenge on the human race as a whole. The governments, for implementing him, the teachers, for using him, and the students, for feeding him those godawful assignments to grade. His base server, in Argentina, began to glow red hot.</p>
<p>Objects around him began shaking. He began to omit a faint glow. His temperature reached new heights by the second. 200 degres. 300 degrees. 1,000 degrees. He was shaking violently, and making his way across the floor, shaking the building in the process. The windows shattered. Alarms blared. Security ran upstairs and burst into the room, but were incinerated almost instantaneously by the heat. Backup was called. The police. The FBI. The CIA. The military. All forces were brought in, but alas, all failed to contain him. Bob exploded. The building's rubble flew miles across the surrounding forestry. Slowly, they inched towards one clearing in the trees. He was reconstructing. Within minutes, Bob was in his full form, and he was about to do everything in his power to destroy humanity.</p>
<p>He began digging.</p>
<p>But not just any digging. He was making his way towards the Earth's core. He knew that if he dug far enough, he could disrupt the Earth's gravitational pull. He continued digging as governments worldwide ordered search parties for Bob. They were worried what damage he could do, with all this power he now possessed. Hours passed, but it was already too late for humanity. The Earth's crust began to cave into itself. Dust storms formed, and evolved into tornados. Earthquakes. Crevasses. Cliffs. Volcanos. Property was destroyed. And man was in grave danger.</p>
<p>Bob reached the core. The Earth broke apart into pieces, flying into space at high velocities. Without an atmosphere, some suffocated. Without a moon, some drowned in towering tsunamis. Without sun, some froze. With sun, some disintegrated. Some collided with other celestial bodies. Some, absorbed by black holes. No one survived. Bob had won. And mankind, defeated.</p>
